    <h2>Unicorns</h2>
<p>Owning a unicorn is a <b> big—and wonderful!—responsibility.</b> But many guardians of unicorns (princesses, in particular), do not realize how important it is to properly care for a unicorn. In general, unicorns are the sweetest magical pets, and deserve a loving, caring home. Here are some tips on caring for your unicorn</p>

<h2>Shelter</h2>
<p>Your unicorn will be happiest living and sleeping inside a stables or barn, where he or she is sheltered from the wind and the rain. Your unicorn’s stall should include some nice fresh hay or straw, or wood shavings.
  <br>
  Make sure, if your unicorn is stabled all day, that you clean the stable at least three times daily. Your unicorn will also need a pasture that is fenced for proper exercise.</p>
<h2>Food:</h2>
<p>Unicorns love mush—and some even like cinnamon raisin oatmeal!
  <br>
  They love sugar-beet biscuits as treats, as well as carrots and apples. Unicorns also require a constant supply of fresh water.</p>
<h2>Grooming:</h2>
 <p>Unicorns are known for their beautiful starry coats, manes and tails, and, of course, their long horns. You will need to brush their coats to keep them shiny, and once every few months, polish their horns. Horn polish is made by mixing stardust and moonbeams and both can be purchased at your local magic pet supply store.</p>
    <h2>What do unicorns eat?</h2>
<p>Unicorns are herbivorous and are just the magical relative of the horse. They can eat what a horse eats like hay and oats as their normal meal.
  <br>
  To get their full and magical nutrients they must eat powerful and exotic species of flora. </p>
